export const aboutText = `With over 25 years of experience building software that improves people's daily lives, I'm excited to bring my expertise in Windows, Azure, and mobile application development to your organization. I've spent my career turning complex requirements into intuitive, reliable solutions, and am seeking an opportunity to continue doing that while embracing new challenges.

In my work, I've designed and shipped Windows applications in C# that streamlined workflows for thousands of end users, built cloud-first solutions with Azure Functions and DevOps pipelines, improving deployment speed and reliability, developed both native Android apps (Java) and cross-platform mobile experiences (Flutter), helping businesses reach users wherever they are, and led full-stack projects in ASP.Net backed by scalable databases and optimized queries.

What drives me is not just writing clean, efficient code, but creating software that genuinely enhances the end-user experience. I believe my blend of deep technical knowledge and adaptability would allow me to contribute immediately to the success of your company.

I'd love the chance to discuss how my background can support your team's goals. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your success.`
